# JavaScript Assignments

It is the first repository of this profile and presents activities with JavaScript that aim to improve the beginner developer's skill in the language. So, here we present the activities performed in this initiation program, so to speak.

## Fortune Teller Assignment  
In this activity, we seek to create a program similar to the fortune teller game. Here, you can assign a value to the variable fortune and, with that, the program would present an adequate answer according to the number (containing three possible answers). However, a number outside the closed range [0,10] will not be recognized by the program.  
Skills used:  
1-Variable declaration  
2-comparison operators  
3-Conditional statements

## Creating Sentences Assignment  
In this activity, we would create a function that takes an array of words as its argument. The function should loop through the array and add each element within an empty string. The function must return a sentence as output at the end.  
Skills used:  
1-array  
2-declare a function  
3-for loop

## JavaScript Tutor: Working with Basic Data Types  
In this practice, it was proposed to create a short story in the vs code. We use variables to represent different elements of history. The program should include the following types of variables: 1 array, 3 integers and 4 strings. In addition, site pythontutor was used as a learning resource, more specifically, the JavaScript Tutor tool, for the development of the exercise.  
Skills used:  
1-Console.log method  
2-Variable integer  
3-Variable boolean and string
 
## Debugging Assignment  
For this activity, we work on the program debugging techniques. There are 4 checkpoints, or programs, in this task. The goal is to manage to run them correctly when using debugging techniques to fix their mistakes. Here, we've made 3 of the 4 existing ones(checkpoint 4 hasn't been done yet). Here, we use again the tool mentioned JavaScript Tutor.  
Skills used:  
1-Using breakpoints  
2-analyzing error messages  
3-printing to the console

## Project Pt 1: PacMan Assignment  
In this exercise, we implemented some codes so that the program can generate a pacman running and tapping the edges of the screen in the horizontal direction. It can be displayed in the browser by running HTML. The file contains the items neeeded for your construction, such as images, JavaScript code and HTML code.  
Skills used:  
1-Conditional statement If  
2-SetInterval method  
3-Introduction to the screen coordinate system, where the Pacman would be

## Project Pt 2: PacMen Factory Assignment  
In this challenge, I would give myself permission to say that we did an "extension" of Project Pt 1: PacMan Assignment. Here, we have valuable content integrating JavaScript with HTML through the Document Object Model (DOM). At this point, we learned more about the basics of HTML, and JavaScript commands that interact with it.Furthermore, the program performs a fun game in which the user can click on two buttons, one makes Pacmen appear on the screen, the other starts the dynamics, allowing the generated Pacmen to wander around the interface and bounce on the edges of the region in which they are located. . By clicking the start button more than once, things get faster.  
Skills used:  
1-Basic concepts of HTML elements and tags  
2-Introduction to the DOM  
3-Beginning of using the getElementById, createElement and appendChild methods  
  
## Unit Testing Activity  
As a final part of this program, we did an exercise to assimilate the content learned regarding unit tests through Node.js, using Jest as support. In this activity, we create unique responses for each of the 5 types of entries (name, uppercase name, 2-element array, more than 2-element array, and null). The difference this time was the inspiration of TDD (Test-Driven Development), which allowed us to build the code based on this technique and do the unit tests, thus knowing exactly what the error was to be fixed, which made it possible to configure of a better program.  
Skills used:  
1-Introduction to Node.js.
2-Introduction to Jest.
3-Introduction to the concept of testing.
