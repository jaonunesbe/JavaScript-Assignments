# Fortune Teller Activity

In this activity, we seek to create a program similar to the fortune teller game. Here, you can assign a value to the variable fortune and, with that, the program would present an adequate answer according to the number (containing three possible answers). However, a number outside the closed range [0,10] will not be recognized by the program.
Skills used:
 1-Variable declaration
 2-comparison operators
 3-Conditional statements
